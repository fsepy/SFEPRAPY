"""
VERSION IDENTIFICATION RULES DOCUMENTED IN PEP 440 ARE FOLLOWED.

Version scheme
==============

Distributions are identified by a public version identifier which supports all defined version comparison operations

The version scheme is used both to describe the distribution version provided by a particular distribution archive, as
well as to place constraints on the version of dependencies needed in order to build or run the software.

Public version identifiers
--------------------------

The canonical public version identifiers MUST comply with the following scheme:

`[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]`

Public version identifiers MUST NOT include leading or trailing whitespace.

Public version identifiers MUST be unique within a given distribution.

See also Appendix B : Parsing version strings with regular expressions which provides a regular expression to check
strict conformance with the canonical format, as well as a more permissive regular expression accepting inputs that may
require subsequent normalization.

Public version identifiers are separated into up to five segments:

    - Epoch segment: N!
    - Release segment: N(.N)*
    - Pre-release segment: {a|b|rc}N
    - Post-release segment: .postN
    - Development release segment: .devN
